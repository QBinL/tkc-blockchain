## tkc-blockchain based on Hyperledger fabric
  on the basis of the open source [fabric series](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric), redevelope to understand the depth of the industry integration with tck which respectively support private chain, chain alliance, and public chain, realize chain security, digital and decentralization, as follows:

-   the transaction process is irreversible, the results can not be tampered with, the transaction process can be tracked.
   
- all process use private key signature, permissions as endorsement, represent user's really behavior, the transaction process can not be interfered, so it realize authorized behavior.

-  the transaction is decentralized,the participating nodes reach  consensus status in the distributed network via pbtf (Byzantine algorithm) to ensure the stability and performance of the transaction.
-  distributed ledger,transaction data which save to any data node and dynamically extended to new nodes.
- intelligent contracts which agreed on business logic can be easily expand.
## redevelop of the Hyperledger fabric  as follows:
<p>fabric-ca and fabric can't sovle  account, applications which isolated issues; </p>
<p>performance monitoring and intelligent routing of fabric nodes;</p>
<p>dynamic extension node and security issues </p>
